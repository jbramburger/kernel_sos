# **Optimizing Time Averages of Dynamical Systems with Kernel Sum-of-Squares**

This repository contains MATLAB scripts to reproduce the data and figures from [Optimizing time averages of dynamical systems with kernel sum-of-squares]() by [Jason J. Bramburger](https://hybrid.concordia.ca/jbrambur/) (2024).

## **Paper Abstract**
Abstract TBD

## **Required MATLAB Packages**
All scripts require YALMIP and MOSEK to run. Both packages can be download for free at 
- YALMIP: https://yalmip.github.io/download/
- MOSEK: https://www.mosek.com/downloads/

## **Repository Contents**
This repository contains MATLAB script to reproduce the results for the examples in Section 6 of the paper. Precisely, the scripts perform the following tasks:
